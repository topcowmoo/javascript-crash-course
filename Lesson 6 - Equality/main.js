// Equality

// The strict equality (===) operator checks whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result. 
// Unlike the equality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types 
// to be different.

console.log(1 === 1);
console.log("hello" === "hello");
console.log("1" === 1);
console.log(0 === false);
